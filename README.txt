In my text adventure you are an anonymous individual who is stuck on a stranded spaceship.
You must use keys to access various rooms and aquire the podkey to use an escape pod.

The game is initialized with 5 rooms and 3 more rooms are opened when the various keys (red, green, blue), are used. All the rooms besides the escape pod room contain some sort of item(s).
The player is able to pick up items and some are useable. The player can quit the game at any time. The player navigates using go DIRECTION. You can take an item using take ITEM. You can drop/destroy an item using drop ITEM. Using look will give you a description of the room and inventory will list the items in your inventory. When you make it to the escape pod room using the podkey will result in victory.
